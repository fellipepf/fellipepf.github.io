## Experience

* **Software Developer (remote), Líder Agropecuária – Campos, RJ, Brazil** - (Jan 2017 – now)
  - I am responsible for developing and deploying the system for managing the company. I'm developing a system using
Angular, Spring Boot and PostgreSQL


* **System Analyst, TCS – TATA Consultancy Services – Macaé, RJ, Brazil** - (Dec 2013 – Dec 2016)
  - Attend the demands of the TATA plant contract at Petrobras – Macaé and working as a software developer on several
systems using Java (JSP, EJB, Spring, Hibernate, RESTful - Jersey) and Groovy (Grails).
In a new contract with Petrobras, now in the software factory model. I had the opportunity to work with the systems
of several Petrobras teams. Performing various tasks such as system improvements based on customer requirements,
bug fixes, implementation of new features and creation of new systems to replace legacy systems. In our team, we
had a culture to test each functionality developed.


* **System Analyst, Spassu Tecnologia e Serviços – Macaé, RJ, Brazil** - (Dec 2009 – Dec 2013)
  - In a new outsourcing contract with Petrobras, continuing the work developed in the same team. Most of the time as
  one of the leading analysts and developers in a Java WebStart project using Swing, EJB and the INT library. It is an
  application for visualization of data obtained from real-time drilling used by engineers and geologists to monitor
  drilling and exploration of oil wells.
  The application known as IVE (Interface Visualization Exata) was developed over the last years and helps geologists
  and engineers on displaying data from oil well drilling retrieved from several third parties companies. It was used
  J2EE architecture at the back-end and Java Web Start at the front-end.
  Accomplishments:
    - Worked on a very complex system
    - Participation in the implementation of agile Scrum development methodology in the team.
    - Developed modules from scratch that are now running in production
    - Creation of automated tests on new features that were developed using JUnit and Mockito.


* **Java Developer, CPM Braxis Capgemini – Macaé, RJ, Brazil** - (Feb 2009 – Dec 2009)
  * As outsourcing employee for PETROBRAS ( http://www.petrobras.com.br/en/ )
  When working as a Java Developer, I was part of the EXATA (EXPLORATION DATA) team. It is a high-level
  scientific software development team founded in the 1980s to provide tools for real-time monitoring of oil well
  drilling operations in onshore and offshore environments for geologists and drilling engineers. The team aimed to
  migrate all the tools from a stack consisting of C code, persistent layer Motif into specific binary files, to a Java Web,
  J2EE, and JBoss stack with persistence layer in PostgreSQL on local stations and Oracle 9i in the datacenter mediated
  by Hibernate, both running on CentOS Linux 4.
  I have worked on various projects such as command-line systems for background execution, web systems and desktop
  systems. The most important in this period


* **Trainee - Programmer, Universidade Candido Mendes – Campos, RJ, Brazil** - (Feb 2005 – Dec 2008)  ( [Description](./projects.html#inforoyalties) )
  * Development of a system to visualize the royalties collected by the beneficiaries and also facilitate the decision
  making on this information.
  * Modelling and creation of the database for the system
  * Creation of routines for loading data into the database (collecting, cleaning and transforming the data to be
  used)
  * Development of the system using the PHP language and PostgreSQL database
  * Visualization of results through graphs and tables
  * Creation of statistical indicators for decision making
  * Cross-referencing royalties with social indicators to carry out studies and analyzes of these data.
